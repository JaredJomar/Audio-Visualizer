# Audio Visualiser Simulator README

## Objective

The objective of this project, titled "Audio Visualiser Simulator," was to enhance an existing audio visualizer application by implementing various features and changes in three distinct phases. This assignment was part of the CIIC4010/ICOM4015 course, with a due date of March 11, 2022.

## Project Overview

When compiled and run, the base application provided four simulation modes. The tasks for this assignment involved adding features and improvements to different aspects of the application. These tasks were divided into three phases, with increasing levels of complexity. The main objectives of each phase were as follows:

### Phase 1 (Suggested Deadline: February 25)

- Change the background color of the application.
- Randomize the color of shapes in all simulation modes.
- Implement the ability to pause and resume shapes using the 'A' key.

### Phase 2 (Suggested Deadline: March 2)

- Implement functionality to change songs using keyboard keys.
- Allow raising and lowering the volume using '=' and '-' keys.
- Enhance the "Rectangle Height Visualizer" mode to display multiple bars responding to individual elements of the "amplitudes" vector.
- Implement a new mode, "Rectangle Width Visualizer," which is similar to the "Rectangle Height Visualizer" but with rectangles growing sideways.

### Phase 3 (Suggested Deadline: March 10)

- Introduce a Record/Replay feature.
  - Pressing 'R' starts recording key presses and actions.
  - An indicator appears during recording.
  - Pressing 'P' replays the recorded actions at fixed intervals.
  - Pressing 'C' cancels a playing replay.
  - An indicator appears during replay.

### Bonus Features (Whenever Possible)

The assignment encouraged creativity and uniqueness in enhancing the application. Students had the opportunity to propose bonus features that significantly improved the application, with the potential to earn bonus points. Examples of bonus features included adding new modes, introducing different shapes for particles, creating a playlist of random replay sequences, or implementing a GUI to control certain actions.

## Project Notes

- The project was completed in teams of two students and hosted on GitHub Classroom.
- Personal repositories were not graded; only team repositories were evaluated.
- Students were advised to follow Git and GitHub best practices, including using branches for each feature.
- Collaboration between team members was encouraged, but individual contributions were expected.
- Regular meetings were recommended to track progress and adjust deadlines or tasks if necessary.
- Students were advised to maintain professionalism in their collaboration, as partners could be future coworkers or job references
